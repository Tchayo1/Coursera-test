    <h3 id="d1">Pain</h3>
     <p>Learning this on a self pace faced with the challenges of no job and no directions is part of the challenges i currently face. I have regular memory loss and that is a great problem for me as well. To be able to face this challenges even at this hour which is a new career path is somthing i certainly am not sure of but for now, i keep on moving</p>

    <h3 id="d2">Emotions</h3>
    <p>My Emotions are mixed and having to learn how to control them is classified as super powers because we are surrounded by it and our perception to things, triger them. Having the ability to choose which just like emojis we use daily on our phone would speak for us</p>

   <div class="box3">
    <h3 id="d3">Experience</h3>
    <p>My experience so far in life has thought me not to expect things to just work out even though sometimes thats how life is. Knowing to live without these expectations will leave you with the option of pushing. We are in an era of connections and being a lone ranger wouldn't get you the desired goal which at the same time leaves you at the mercy of insanity, risking your peace by association</p>
